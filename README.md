# High Dimensional Networked Systems: Learning, Monitoring, Diagnosis, and Prognosis

hdn-gnosis is under development for solving problems related to system-level decision making and quality improvement. 
We are researching and developing methodologies for modeling, monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis of complex networked systems, 
such as brain connectivity networks, social networks, cyber-physics systems, and manufacturing systems. 

hdn-gnosis is based on the research of novel statistical and data mining models to process massive heterogeneous datasets 
such as neuroimaging, genomics, proteomics, laboratory tests, demographics, and clinical variables. It had helped for facilitating scientific 
discoveries in biomedical research and better decision making in clinical practices.
